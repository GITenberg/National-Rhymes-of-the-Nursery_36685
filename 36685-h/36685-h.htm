<p class="caption">INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>It is a good many years since Peacock, in one of those curiously
ill-tempered and not particularly happy attacks on the Lake poets, with
which he chose to diversify his earlier novels, conceived, as an
ornament of "Mainchance Villa," a grand allegorical picture, depicting
the most famous characters of English Nursery Tales, Rhymes,
&amp;c.&mdash;Margery Daw, Jack and Jill, the other Jack who built the House, the
chief figures of "that sublime strain of immortal genius" called
<i>Dickory Dock</i>, and the third Jack, Horner, eating a symbolic Christmas
pie. At the date of <i>Melincourt</i>, in which this occurs, its even then
admirable author was apt to shoot his arrows rather at a venture; and it
may be hoped, without too much rashness, that he did not mean to speak
disrespectfully of the "sublime strain of immortal genius" itself, but
only of what he thought Wordsworth's corrupt following of that and
similar things.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if he had lived a little longer, or if (for he lived quite
long enough) he had been in the mind for such game, he might have found
fresh varieties of it in certain more modern handlings of the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>subject. Since the Brothers Grimm founded modern folklore, it has
required considerable courage to approach nursery songs and nursery
tales in any but a spirit of the severest "scientism," which I presume
to be the proper form for the method of those who call themselves
"scientists." We have not only had investigations&mdash;some of them by no
means unfruitful or uninteresting investigations&mdash;into certain things
which are, or may be, the originals of these artless compositions in
history or in popular manners. We have not only had some of their queer
verbal jingles twisted back again into what may have been an articulate
and authentic meaning. I do not know that many of them have been made
out to be sun-myths; but that yesterday popular, to-day rather
discredited, system of exposition is very evidently as applicable to
them as to anything else. The older variety of mystical and moral
interpretation having gone out of fashion before they had emerged from
the contempt of the learned, it has not been much applied to them,
though the temptation is great, for, as King Charles observes in
"Woodstock," most things in the world remind one of the tales of Mother
Goose.</p>

<p>But the most special attentions that nursery rhymes have received have,
perhaps, taken the form of the elaborate and ingenious divisions
attempted by Halliwell and others. Indeed, something of the kind has
been so common that the absence here of anything similar may excite some
surprise, and look like disrespect to a scientific age. The omission,
however, is designed, and a reason or two may be rendered for it.
Halliwell (to take the most generally known instance) has no less than
seventeen compartments in which he stows remorselessly these "things
that are old and pretty," to apply to them a phrase that Lamb loved.
There are, it seems, historical nursery rhymes, literal nursery rhymes;
nursery rhymes narrative, proverbial, scholastic, lyrical, riddlesome;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>rhymes dealing with charms, with gaffers and gammers, with games, with
paradoxes, with lullabies, with jingles, with love and matrimony, with
natural (I wish he had called it unnatural) history, with accumulative
stories, with localities, with relics. It may be permitted to cry "Mercy
on us," when one thinks of the poor little wildings, so full of nature
and, if not ignorant of art, of an art so cunningly concealed, being
subjected to the trimmings and torturings of the <i>Ars Topiaria</i> after
this fashion. The division is clearly arbitrary and non-natural; it is
often what logicians very properly object to as a "cross"-division; it
leads to the inclusion of many things which are not properly nursery
rhymes at all; and it necessitates, or at least gives occasion to, a
vast amount of idle talk. For instance, take King Arthur, this way, that
way, which way you please: as a hero of history, as a great central
figure of romance, or even (I grieve to say a learned friend of mine is
wont to speak of him so) as a "West-Welsh thief." Are we called upon in
the very slightest degree to connect any of these Arthurs with the
artist of the bag-pudding? to discuss what was the material that Queen
Guinevere preferred for frying, and to select the most probable
"noblemen" from the Table Round? Does anybody, except as a rather
ponderous joke, care to discuss whether King Cole was really father of
Constantine's mother, and had anything to do with Colchester? Though it
may be admitted that a "Colchester carpet-bag," that is to say, a very
thick steak all but sliced through and stuffed with oysters, would
probably not have been unacceptable to the monarch as a preliminary to
the bowl.</p>

<p>The simple fact seems to be, that one of Halliwell's
partitions&mdash;"jingles"&mdash;will do for the whole seventeen, and do a great
deal better than the other sixteen of them. It may be perfectly true
that most of the things indicated in these class-names supplied, in this
case and that, basis for the jingle, starting-points, texts, and so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>forth. But all genuine nursery rhymes (even in fragments such as
"Martin Swart and his men, Sodledum [saddle them], sodledum," if it is
genuine, and others where definite history comes in) have never become
nursery rhymes until the historical fact has been practically forgotten
by those who used them, and nothing but the metrical and musical
attraction remains. Some of the alphabet and number rhymes may possibly
(it is sad to have to confess it) have been composed with a deliberate
purpose of instruction; but it is noticeable that these have never
become quite the genuine thing, except in cases such as&mdash;</p>

<p class="p6 noin">"Big A, little a, bouncing B,<br />
The cat's in the cupboard, and she can't see,"</p>

<p class="noin">where the subtle tendency to nonsense takes the weak intention of sense
on its back as a fox does a chicken and runs right away with it. Again,
it would be rash to say that it is impossible to make out popular
customs and popular beliefs from these texts. But it is quite certain
that they have for the most part left the customs and the beliefs a long
way behind them, that these things are, to vary the metaphor, merely in
palimpsest relation to the present purport and contents of the rhymes.</p>

<p>Perhaps, therefore, while not grudging folklorists their perquisitions
in this delightful region, and while acknowledging that there are many
interesting things to be found out by them in it, we may be permitted to
look at nursery rhymes from a rather different point of view. And from
this point it will not, I think, be fanciful to see in them, to a great
extent, the poetical appeal of sound as opposed to that of meaning
expressed in its simplest and most unmistakable terms. We shall find in
these pieces the two special pillars of all modern poetry, alliteration
and rhyme, or at least assonance, which is only rhyme undeveloped. And
we shall find something else, which I venture to call
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
the attraction of
the inarticulate. It is not necessary to take the cynical sense of the
famous saying, that language was given to man to conceal his thoughts,
in order to admit that in moments of more intense and genuine feeling,
if not of thought, he does not as a rule use or at least confine himself
to articulate speech. If the "little language" of mothers to babies be
set down to a supposition that the object addressed does not understand,
that will hardly explain the other "little language" of lovers to
lovers, which has a tendency to be nearly as inarticulate as a
cradle-song, and quite as corruptive of dictionary speech as a nursery
rhyme. In the very stammering of rage there may be thought to be
something more than a simple inability to choose between words; and in
the moaning of sorrow something more than an inability to find suitable
expression. All children&mdash;and children, as somebody (I forget who he
was, but he was a wise man) has said, are usually very clever people
till they get spoilt&mdash;fall naturally, long after they are quite able to
express themselves as it is called rationally, into a sort of pleasant
gibberish when they are alone and pleased, or even displeased. And I
dare say that a fair number of very considerably grown-up folk, who have
not only come to the legal years of discretion but to the poetical age
of wisdom, do the like now and then.</p>

<p class="p8 noin">"As one walks by oneself,<br />
And talks to oneself,"</p>

<p class="noin">by the seaside or on a lonely country road, it must be a not infrequent
experience of most people that one frequently falls into pure jingle and
nonsense-verse of the nursery kind. In fact, it must have happened to
more people than one, or one thousand, by the malice of a sudden corner
or the like, to have been caught doing so to their great confusion, and
to the comfortable conviction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> of the other party that he has met with
an escaped lunatic.</p>

<p>I should myself, though I may not carry many people with me, go farther
than this and say that this "attraction of the inarticulate," this
allurement of mere sound and sequence, has a great deal more to do than
is generally thought with the charm of the very highest poetry, and that
no merely valuable thought presented without this accompaniment can
possibly affect us as it does when it summons to its aid such concert of
vowels and consonants as&mdash;</p>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">"Peace! peace!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Dost thou not see my baby at my breast</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">That sucks the nurse asleep?"</span><br />

<p class="noin">or as&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 12em;">"Qu&aelig;rens me sedisti lassus,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Redemisti crucem passus;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Tantus labor non sit cassus!"</span><br />
<br />
<p>In the best nursery rhymes, as in the simpler and more genuine ballads
which have so close a connection with them, we find this attraction of
the inarticulate&mdash;this charm of pure sound, this utilising of
alliteration and rhyme and assonance, and the cunning juxtaposition now
of similar, now of contrary vowels&mdash;not in a passionate, but in a frank
and simple form. Many of them probably, some of them certainly, had, as
has been said, a definite meaning once, and we may attend to the
folklorist as he expounds what it was or may have been; but for the most
part they have very victoriously got the better of that meaning, have
bid it, in their own lingo, "go to Spain," without the slightest
meditation or back-thought whether Spain is the proper place for it or
not. In that particular <i>locus classicus</i> "Spain" rhymes to "rain," and
that is not merely the chief and principal, but the absolutely
all-sufficient thing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> So, too, there is no doubt a most learned
explanation of the jargon (variously given and spelt)&mdash;</p>

<p class="noin p4">"Hotum-potum, paradise tantum, perry-merry-dictum, domaree,"</p>

<p>at which a friend of mine used to laugh consumedly, declaring that this
cavalier coupling of "paradise <i>tantum</i>" "<i>only</i> paradise," was the
nicest thing he knew. But the people who mellowed it into that form, and
recited it afterwards, never cared one scrap for the meaning. They had
got it into a pleasant jingle of vowels, a desirable sequence of
consonants, and a good swing of cadence, and that was enough. When
"Curlylocks" is invited to be "mine" by the promise "thou shalt sew a
fine seam," does anybody suppose that this housewifely operation was
much more (it may have been a little more) of a bait to the Curlylocks
of those days than to the Curlylocks of these? Not at all. "Sew" and
"seam" went naturally together, they made a pleasing alliteration, and
the latter word rhymed to "cream," of which the Curlylocks of all days
has been not unusually fond.</p>

<p>Not, of course, that there is not much wit and much wisdom, much
picturesqueness and not a little pathos in our rhymes. All good men have
justly admired these qualities in "Sing a Song of Sixpence" and
"Ding-dong Bell," in "Margery Daw" and "Who Killed Cock Robin?" I rather
suspect the wicked literary man of having more to do than genuine
popular sentiment with the delightful progress and ending of "There was
a Little Boy and a Little Girl." But the undoubtedly genuine notes are
numerous enough and various enough, from that previously mentioned and
admirable thrift of good King Arthur, or rather of Queen Guinevere (from
whom, according to naughty romancers, we should have less expected it),
to the sound common-sense of "Three Children;" from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> the decorative
convention of "Little Boy Blue" to the arabesque and even grotesque of
"Hey-diddle-diddle."</p>

<p>But I shall still contend that the main, the pervading, the
characteristic attraction of them lies in their musical accompaniment of
purely senseless sound, in their rhythm, rhyme, jingle, refrain, and the
like, in the simplicity and freshness of their modulated form. For thus
they serve as anthems and doxologies to the goddess whom in this context
it is not satirical to call "<i>Divine</i> Nonsensia," who still in all lands
and times condescends now and then to unbind the burden of meaning from
the backs and brains of men, and lets them rejoice once more in pure,
natural, senseless sound.</p>

<p><b><i>The Spider and the Fly</i></b></p>

<p class="p4">"Will you walk into my parlour?" said the spider to the fly,&mdash;<br />
"'Tis the prettiest little parlour that ever you did spy.<br />
The way into my parlour is up a winding stair;<br />
And I have many curious things to show you when you're there."<br />
"Oh no, no," said the little fly; "to ask me is in vain;<br />
For who goes up your winding stair can ne'er come down again."<br />
<br />
<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
"I'm sure you must be weary, dear, with soaring up so high;<br />
Will you rest upon my little bed?" said the spider to the fly.<br />
"There are pretty curtains drawn around; the sheets are fine and thin;<br />
And if you like to rest awhile, I'll snugly tuck you in!"<br />
"Oh no, no," said the little fly; "for I've often heard it said,<br />
They never, never wake again, who sleep upon your bed!"<br />
<br />
Said the cunning spider to the fly&mdash;"Dear friend, what can I do<br />
To prove the warm affection I've always felt for you?<br />
<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
I have within my pantry good store of all that's nice;<br />
I'm sure you're very welcome&mdash;will you please to take a slice?"<br />
"Oh no, no," said the little fly, "kind sir, that cannot be;<br />
I've heard what's in your pantry, and I do not wish to see."<br />
<br />
"Sweet creature," said the spider, "you're witty and you're wise;<br />
How handsome are your gauzy wings, how brilliant are your eyes!<br />
I have a little looking-glass upon my parlour shelf,<br />
If you'll step in one moment, dear, you shall behold yourself."<br />
<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
"I thank you, gentle sir," she said, "for what you're pleased to say,<br />
And bidding you good-morning now, I'll call another day."<br />
<br />
The spider turned him round about, and went into his den,<br />
For well he knew the silly fly would soon come back again;<br />
So he wove a subtle web in a little corner sly,<br />
And set his table ready, to dine upon the fly.<br />
Then he came out to his door again, and merrily did sing,&mdash;<br />
"Come hither, hither, pretty fly, with the pearl and silver wing;<br />
Your robes are green and purple&mdash;there's a crest upon your head!<br />
Your eyes are like the diamond bright, but mine are dull as lead!"<br />
<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
<br />
Alas! alas! how very soon this silly little fly,<br />
Hearing his wily, flattering words, came slowly flitting by.<br />
With buzzing wings she hung aloft, then near and nearer drew,<br />
Thinking only of her brilliant eyes, her green and purple hue&mdash;<br />
Thinking only of her crested head&mdash;poor foolish thing! At last,<br />
Up jumped the cunning spider, and fiercely held her fast!<br />
He dragged her up his winding stair, into his dismal den,<br />
Within his little parlour&mdash;but she ne'er came out again!<br />
<br />
And now, dear little children, who may this story read,<br />
To idle, silly flattering words, I pray you, ne'er give heed;<br />
<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
Unto an evil counsellor close heart, and ear, and eye.<br />

<p class="p7 m16"><b>OHN</b> Gilpin was a citizen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of credit and renown,</span><br />
A train-band captain eke was he,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of famous London town.</span><br />
<br />
John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Though wedded we have been</span><br />
These twice ten tedious years, yet we<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No holiday have seen.</span><br />
<br />
"To-morrow is our wedding-day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we will then repair</span><br />
Unto the 'Bell' at Edmonton,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All in a chaise and pair.</span><br />
<br />
"My sister, and my sister's child,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Myself, and children three</span><br />
Will fill the chaise; so you must ride<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On horseback after we."</span><br />

<br />

<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
He soon replied, "I do admire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of womankind but one,</span><br />
And you are she, my dearest dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Therefore it shall be done.</span><br />
<br />
"I am a linendraper bold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As all the world doth know,</span><br />
And my good friend the calender<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will lend his horse to go."</span><br />
<br />
Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, "That's well said;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And for that wine is dear,</span><br />
We will be furnished with our own,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which is both bright and clear."</span><br />
<br />
John Gilpin kissed his losing wife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'erjoyed was he to find,</span><br />
That though on pleasure she was bent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She had a frugal mind.</span><br />

<br />

<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>

The morning came, the chaise was brought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But yet was not allowed</span><br />
To drive up to the door, lest all<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should say that she was proud.</span><br />
<br />
So three doors off the chaise was stayed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where they did all get in;</span><br />
Six precious souls, and all agog<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To dash through thick and thin.</span><br />
<br />
Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were never folks so glad!</span><br />
The stones did rattle underneath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As if Cheapside were mad.</span><br />
<br />
John Gilpin at his horse's side<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seized fast the flowing mane,</span><br />
And up he got, in haste to ride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But soon came down again.</span><br />

<br />

<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>

For saddletree scarce reached had he,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His journey to begin,</span><br />
When, turning round his head, he saw<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Three customers come in.</span><br />
<br />
So down he came; for loss of time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Although it grieved him sore,</span><br />
Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would trouble him much more.</span><br />
<br />
'Twas long before the customers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were suited to their mind,</span><br />
When Betty screaming came downstairs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The wine is left behind!"</span><br />
<br />
"Good lack!" quoth he, "yet bring it me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My leathern belt likewise,</span><br />
In which I bear my trusty sword<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I do exercise."</span><br />

<br />

<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>

Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had two stone bottles found,</span><br />
To hold the liquor that she loved,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And keep it safe and sound.</span><br />
<br />
Each bottle had a curling ear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through which the belt he drew,</span><br />
And hung a bottle on each side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To make his balance true.</span><br />
<br />
Then over all, that he might be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Equipped from top to toe,</span><br />
His long red cloak, well brushed and neat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He manfully did throw.</span><br />
<br />
Now see him mounted once again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon his nimble steed,</span><br />
Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With caution and good heed.</span><br />

<br />

<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>

But finding soon a smoother road<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath his well-shod feet,</span><br />
The snorting beast began to trot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which galled him in his seat.</span><br />
<br />
"So, fair and softly!" John he cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But John he cried in vain;</span><br />
That trot became a gallop soon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In spite of curb and rein.</span><br />
<br />
So stooping down, as needs he must<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who cannot sit upright,</span><br />
He grasped the mane with both his hands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And eke with all his might.</span><br />
<br />
His horse, who never in that sort<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had handled been before,</span><br />
What thing upon his back had got,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did wonder more and more.</span><br />

<br />

<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>

Away went Gilpin, neck or nought;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Away went hat and wig;</span><br />
He little dreamt, when he set out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of running such a rig.</span><br />
<br />
The wind did blow, the cloak did fly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like streamer long and gay,</span><br />
Till, loop and button failing both,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last it flew away.</span><br />
<br />
Then might all people well discern<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bottles he had slung;</span><br />
A bottle swinging at each side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As hath been said or sung.</span><br />
<br />
The dogs did bark, the children screamed.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up flew the windows all;</span><br />
And every soul cried out, "Well done!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As loud as he could bawl.</span><br />

<br />

<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>

Away went Gilpin&mdash;who but he?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His fame soon spread around:</span><br />
"He carries weight! he rides a race!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis for a thousand pound!"</span><br />
<br />
And still as fast as he drew near,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twas wonderful to view</span><br />
How in a trice the turnpike-men<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their gates wide open threw.</span><br />
<br />
And now, as he went bowing down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His reeking head full low,</span><br />
The bottles twain behind his back<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were shattered at a blow.</span><br />
<br />
Down ran the wine into the road,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Most piteous to be seen,</span><br />
Which made the horse's flanks to smoke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As they had basted been.</span><br />

<br />

<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
But still he seemed to carry weight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With leathern girdle braced;</span><br />
For all might see the bottle-necks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still dangling at his waist.</span><br />
<br />
Thus all through merry Islington<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These gambols he did play,</span><br />
Until he came unto the Wash<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Edmonton so gay;</span><br />
<br />
And there he threw the wash about<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On both sides of the way,</span><br />
Just like unto a trundling mop.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or a wild goose at play.</span><br />
<br />
At Edmonton his loving wife<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the balcony spied</span><br />
Her tender husband, wondering much<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To see how he did ride.</span><br />

<br />

<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>

"Stop, stop, John Gilpin!&mdash;Here's the house!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They all at once did cry;</span><br />
"The dinner waits, and we are tired,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said Gilpin&mdash;"So am I!"</span><br />
<br />
But yet his horse was not a whit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Inclined to tarry there;</span><br />
For why?&mdash;his owner had a house<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full ten miles off, at Ware.</span><br />
<br />
So like an arrow swift he flew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shot by an archer strong;</span><br />
So did he fly&mdash;which brings me to<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The middle of my song.</span><br />
<br />
Away went Gilpin out of breath<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sore against his will,</span><br />
Till at his friend the calender's.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His horse at last stood still.</span><br />

<br />

<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>

The calender, amazed to see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His neighbour in such trim,</span><br />
Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thus accosted him:</span><br />
<br />
"What news? what news? your tidings tell;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tell me you must and shall&mdash;</span><br />
Say why bareheaded you are come,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or why you come at all?"</span><br />
<br />
Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And loved a timely joke;</span><br />
And thus unto the calender<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In merry guise he spoke:</span><br />
<br />
"I came because your horse would come:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, if I well forebode,</span><br />
My hat and wig will soon be here,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They are upon the road."</span><br />

<br />

<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>

The calender, right glad to find<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His friend in merry pin,</span><br />
Returned him not a single word,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But to the house went in;</span><br />
<br />
Whence straight he came with hat and wig,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A wig that flowed behind,</span><br />
A hat not much the worse for wear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each comely in its kind.</span><br />
<br />
He held them up, and in his turn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus showed his ready wit,</span><br />
"My head is twice as big as yours,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They therefore needs must fit.</span><br />
<br />
"But let me scrape the dirt away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That hangs upon your face;</span><br />
And stop and eat, for well you may<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be in a hungry case."</span><br />

<br />

<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>

Said John, "It is my wedding-day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all the world would stare</span><br />
If wife should dine at Edmonton,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I should dine at Ware."</span><br />
<br />
So turning to his horse, he said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I am in haste to dine;</span><br />
'Twas for your pleasure you came here,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You shall go back for mine."</span><br />
<br />
Ah! luckless speech, and bootless boast!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For which he paid full dear;</span><br />
For while he spake, a braying ass<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did sing most loud and clear;</span><br />
<br />
Whereat his horse did snort, as he<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had heard a lion roar,</span><br />
And galloped off with all his might,<br />

Away went Gilpin, and away<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Went Gilpin's hat and wig:</span><br />
He lost them sooner than at first,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For why&mdash;they were too big.</span><br />
<br />
Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her husband posting down</span><br />
Into the country far away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She pulled out half-a-crown;</span><br />
<br />
And thus unto the youth she said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That drove them to the "Bell,"</span><br />
"This shall be yours when you bring back<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My husband safe and well."</span><br />
<br />
The youth did ride, and soon did meet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">John coming back amain;</span><br />
Whom in a trice he tried to stop,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By catching at his rein;</span><br />

<br />

<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
But not performing what he meant,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gladly would have done,</span><br />
The frighted steed he frighted more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And made him faster run.</span><br />
<br />
Away went Gilpin, and away<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Went postboy at his heels,</span><br />
The postboy's horse right glad to miss<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lumbering of the wheels.</span><br />
<br />
Six gentlemen upon the road,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus seeing Gilpin fly,</span><br />
With postboy scampering in the rear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They raised the hue and cry.</span><br />
<br />
"Stop thief! stop thief! a highwayman!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not one of them was mute;</span><br />
And all and each that passed that way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did join in the pursuit.</span><br />

<br />

<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>

And now the turnpike gates again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flew open in short space;</span><br />
The toll-men thinking, as before,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Gilpin rode a race.</span><br />
<br />
And so he did, and won it too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he got first to town;</span><br />
Nor stopped till where he had got up,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He did again get down.</span><br />
<br />
Now let us sing, "Long live the King,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Gilpin, long live he;"</span><br />
And when he next doth ride abroad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May I be there to see.</span></p>

This dog and man at first were friends,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, when a pique began,</span><br />
The dog, to gain some private ends,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Went mad, and bit the man.</span><br />
<br />
Around from all the neighbouring streets<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wondering neighbours ran;</span><br />
And swore the dog had lost his wits,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To bite so good a man.</span><br />
<br />
The wound it seemed both sore and sad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To every Christian eye;</span><br />
And while they swore the dog was mad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They swore the man would die.</span><br />
<br />
But soon a wonder came to light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That showed the rogues they lied&mdash;</span><br />
The man recovered of the bite;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dog it was that died.</span></p>

The old woman seized her sweeping broom,<br />

The ground was covered with frost and snow,<br />

<p class="p4"><span style="margin-left: 3em;">This is the death of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Little Jenny Wren,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And what the doctors</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">All said then.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Jenny Wren was sick again,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And Jenny Wren did die;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The doctors vowed they'd cure her,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or know the reason why.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Doctor Hawk felt her pulse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And, shaking his head,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said, "I fear I can't save her,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Because she's quite dead."</span><br />
<br />
Doctor Hawk's a clever fellow,<br />
He pinched her wrist enough to kill her.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"She'll do very well yet,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then said Doctor Fox,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"If she takes but one pill</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From out of this box."</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Ah! Doctor Fox,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You are very cunning,</span><br />
For if she's dead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You will not get one in.</span><br />
<br />
With hartshorn in hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came Doctor Tom-Tit,</span><br />
Saying, "Really, good sirs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It's only a fit."</span><br />
<br />
You're right, Doctor Tit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You need make no doubt on,</span><br />
But death is a fit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Folk seldom get out on.</span><br />
<br />
Doctor Cat says, "Indeed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I don't think she's dead,</span><br />
I believe if I try,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She yet might be bled."</span><br />
<br />

You need not a lancet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Miss Pussy, indeed,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A poor Wren to bleed.</span><br />
<br />
"I think, Puss, you're foolish,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then says Doctor Goose,</span><br />
"For to bleed a dead Wren<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can be of no use."</span><br />
<br />
Why, Doctor Goose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You're very wise,</span><br />
Your wisdom profound<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Might Ganders surprise.</span><br />
<br />
Doctor Jack Ass then said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"See this balsam, I make it;</span><br />
She yet may survive<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If you get her to take it."</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagelarge"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
What you say, Doctor Ass,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Perhaps may be true;</span><br />
I ne'er saw the dead drink, though<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pray, Doctor, did you?</span><br />
<br />
Doctor Owl then declared<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the cause of her death</span><br />
He really believed, was&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The want of more breath.</span><br />
<br />
Indeed, Doctor Owl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You are much in the right;</span><br />
You as well might have said<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That day was not night.</span><br />
<br />
Says Robin, "Get out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You're a parcel of quacks,</span><br />
Or I'll lay this good whip<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On each of your backs."</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They stayed for no fees,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They were glad to get out.</span><br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
